Welcome to WitnessChain! This folder contains code for our three apps: a Node.js server, an iOS app for citizens, and an iOS app for police.

## Demo

## Subfolders 

We have three subfolders, one for each of our apps: `server`, `ios-citizen`, and `ios-police`. Each folder contains all the associated code as well as a README with instructions for how to run the app locally.

## GitHub

You can also find our code [on the WitnessChain GitHub](https://github.com/witnesschain/witnesschain).
